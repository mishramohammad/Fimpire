# Fimpire - UX/UI project

A bookkeeping app – Fimpire - designed to record and process business transactions, while being user-friendly for local stores and individuals with little to no 
experience with financial records.

# Problem 
Being unable to manage finances or using sites and apps that don’t completely allow you to manage finances (running into glitches, not having some 
features).

# Goal
The goal of this project is to understand users who face the issue of not handling finances or unable to record everything, and to create an app that would 
eliminate these issues
